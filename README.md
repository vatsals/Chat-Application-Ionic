This application is a basic chat application build on Angular4 and IONIC3. 

This app provides a platform where multiple users can login and join the chat. They can send messages which will get updated live on the other user's chat page. 
The app continually monitors the event when the user logs in and logs out. A message is being displayed when this event is triggered. 

Here's the link to the youtube demonstration of its functionality: https://youtu.be/UmuR6F92IPA
